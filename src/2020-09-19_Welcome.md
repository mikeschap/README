# Welcome to `README`

I'm hoping to share my thoughts here.

I've toyed with the idea of starting a blog for a while now, but it was the revelation that Github is the right place to do it that spurred action.

For me, for this blog to exist, the friction had to be low. Github is all markdown and git, which I already do professionally.

I'm also kind of delighted that I get to say things like, "new commits every friday."

Cheers to us for being here at this first post - me now and you sometime in the (potentially distant) future. 

I'm looking forward to seeing how it all turns out.
