When you've eaten one too many poorly designed sandwiches, as I have now, you can't help but think about the lineage of choices that lead to such meager results.

Let's be clear: no one likes ciabatta. Try to find one person who likes ciabatta - good luck. I suspect that ciabatta was born of economic conspiracy and serves very well its masters but intends no such benefit to unwitting consumers. Ciabatta's rind is tough - _leathery_ - and its interior lattice is perniciously glutenous, spelling intended. Ciabatta presents an experience best suited to individuals with mouths full of canines and well-developed necks and jaws, perhaps akin to species that subsist on raw meat.

The mechanics necessary to eat ciabatta do not overlap with those regulary employed to eat sandwiches. Biting into ciabatta with the pressure required to sever it with human teeth naturally activates the potential spring forces coiled within its bready catacombs to squeeze its contents laterally out. This effect can be magnified greatly by choice of fillings. Those that act as lubricants, such as mayonnaise, mustard, tomato, cucumber, avocado, and all varieties of deli meat, reduce the threshold pressure at which your sandwich's innards willingly abandon their post.

Ciabatta resolves to occupy only the far ends of the moisture bell curve, never the center. There is seemingly no end to ciabatta's ability to absorb and displace solutions, dressings, and oils with no corresponding rise in edibility. However, if you so much as leave ciabatta in contact with a slice of tomato while you return to the fridge for condiments, ciabatta will dissolve into non-structural porridge, probably out of spite.

The next time you have the notion to participate in a sandwich with ciabatta, understand that it could have only been achieved by a subversion of your better judgement, and that retreat is an option in such dire straits.
