When you've eaten one too many poorly designed sandwiches, as I have now, you can't help but think about the lineage of choices that lead to such meager results.

Let's be clear: no one likes cibatta. Try to find one person who likes cibatta - good luck. I suspect that cibatta was born of economic conspiracy and serves very well its masters but intends no such benefit to unwitting consumers. Cibatta's rind is tough - _leathery_ - and its interior lattice is perniciously glutenous, spelling intended. Cibatta presents an experience best suited to individuals with mouths full of canines and well-developed necks and jaws, perhaps akin to species that subsist on raw meat.

The mechanics necessary to eat cibatta do not overlap with those regulary employed to eat sandwiches. Biting into cibatta with the pressure required to sever it with human teeth naturally activates the potential spring forces coiled within its bready catacombs to squeeze its contents laterally out. This effect can be magnified greatly by choice of fillings. Those that act as lubricants, such as mayonnaise, mustard, tomato, cucumber, avocado, and all varieties of deli meat, reduce the threshold pressure at which your sandwich's innards willingly abandon their post.

The next time you have the notion to participate in a sandwich of cibatta, mayonnaise, mustard, tomato, cucumber, avocado, and any variety of deli meat, understand that it could have only been achieved by a subversion of your better judgement, and that retreat is an option in such dire straits.
