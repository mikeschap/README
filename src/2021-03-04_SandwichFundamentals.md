This post was inspired by a sandwich I recently had the displeasure of eating.

No one likes ciabatta. Try to find one person who likes ciabatta - good luck. If you think you're that person, think again.

I suspect that ciabatta was born of economic conspiracy and serves its masters well, but accept no apology that claims any benefit to consumers. Ciabatta's rind is tough - _leathery_ - and its interior structure is bouncy and superficially waxy. Ciabatta delivers an eating experience best suited to species with mouths full of canines and well-developed necks and jaws.

The mechanics of eating ciabatta are not related to those employed for other sandwiches. Biting into ciabatta with the pressure required to sever it with human teeth naturally activates the spring forces coiled in its bready catacombs to squeeze the contents of the sandwich out laterally. This effect can be magnified greatly by choice of fillings. Those that act as lubricants, such as mayonnaise, mustard, tomato, cucumber, avocado, and all varieties of deli meat, reduce the threshold at which your sandwich's innards willingly abandon their post.

Ciabatta resolves to occupy the far ends of the moisture bell curve, never the center. There is seemingly no end to ciabatta's ability to absorb and displace solutions, dressings, and oils with no corresponding rise in edibility. However, if you leave ciabatta in contact with so much as a slice of tomato while you return to the fridge for condiments, ciabatta will dissolve into non-structural porridge, probably out of spite.

The next time you have the notion to participate in a sandwich with ciabatta, understand that you have been decieved by yourself or others and that the sunk cost of having prepared a sandwich does not demand you suffer through it.
