Every once in a while, I get a call from my bank, or my internet provider, or some other entity that I interface with about our mutual business.

The conversations often start like this:

```
“Hi, this is Michael.”

“Hello, sir, this is Janet calling from Example Bank. Am I speaking with Mr. Schappel?”

“You are. How are you today, Janet?”

“Oh! Uh, I’m doing well, sir, how are you?”

...
```

More often than not, the caller is surprised, pleasantly, that I asked.

Small things have power. A small gesture of good will may push the recipient into making their own gesture, and, in that way, your gesture may reverberate around the world, carrying its own energy and leaving people better than they were before.

It works the same way with incivility. We live in a bubbling sea of small forces pushing us towards one moral pole or another.

There may be something more to say about the world we live in today - mass distribution of disinformation, the decline in violence over the last two millennia except for the 60s and perhaps now, the historic divide in the minds of Americans - but I’ll leave that for a future academic exercise.

Here’s what I’ll say now: care about people, near and far.

Push back against the turmoil of our age with the rising resonance of passing kindness.
