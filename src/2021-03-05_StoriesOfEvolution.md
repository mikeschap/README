Joe, a long, slender insect, started to sweat. He stood face to face with his stronger, heavier rival, Bill, on a branch in the tree they both called home. It wasn't pride on the line, it was life.

Joe and Bill had never appreciated each others' company. In fact, they found each other quite grating. Joe was a know-it-all, and Bill was somewhat of a meathead. When they were younger, Joe casually lobbed insults at Bill about his dullness, which always got laughs from the girls. Bill never had a clever retort, just an ape-like shove and the same, "You'll see. When we're older, you'll see." That day had come; it was time to resolve who was welcome to enjoy their tree's fruitful splendor and who would be relegated to certain death on the forest floor below.

As they stared each other down, a crowd gathered around them. Fights like these were common, and the familiar catcalls for violence began to sound off.

Joe was sure that combat with Bill meant injury, and injury guaranteed death. Falling? Maybe not. "We never see anyone who falls ever again, but maybe that's because they like it down there," he thought. It was worth a shot; he decided to throw the fight, incur the defeat, and avoid the wound.

Bill's still, obsidian eyes twitched, and then he lunged. Joe closed his eyes and steeled himself. A whip of air rushed through and shrill screams of terror erupted from all around.

Joe's eyes sprang open to find the last glimpse of Bill he, or anyone, would ever have: clutched in a bird's gnarled claw. The bird had been drawn by the commotion of the crowd, and had greedily selected the plumpest, juiciest of prey from the smörgåsbord: Bill. As the bird breached the canopy, grasping his meal ungently, Bill's eyes glimmered for the last time.

Joe and his progeny were happy to discover that things happened that way more often than not. The longer, more slender, and more stick-like they became with each generation, the less they had to worry about birds and Bills, until they looked identical to the branches they occupied.

Evolution, whom his friends and colleagues called Evan, put his face in his hands.

On iteration thirty-nine, coincidentally one fewer than it took the WD-40 company to get their formula right, Evan's design for homo sapiens was tough and flexible enough to survive everything the Horn of Africa had to offer, and that was a problem.

After putting the time and effort into enabling homo sapiens to think about their problems, they now had practically none. The storms had come and gone, and the homo sapiens survived. Famines, too. Everything had been tried. Evan considered hanging up his hat.

As he flipped the light switch on his way out of the office, perhaps for the last time, something occurred to Evan: nothing hadn't been tried. That is to say, "nothing" hadn't been tried. It was an odd notion, but there was nothing to lose.

Evan got to the office early the next morning, poured his first cup of coffee, and got down to business. He watched, and he waited, while the homo sapiens did well, excelled, even. He waited some more.

His eyes began to strain as the light of the day waned from the windows. His fifth cup of coffee had him feeling like a salted slug. A daydream started to materialize in the back of his mind, but then something jolted him.

An older homo sapien, one that had valiantly weathered life, made an odd mistake. It had left its village alone at dusk, and a lioness crouched nearby capitalized on the opportunity to turn the homo sapien into a meal.

Evan leaned back in his pleather chair and pondered the event. It was a grave misstep, to leave alone at dusk - something that homo sapiens strictly avoided. This elder should have known better - why hadn't it?

Evan rewound the tape. He found the elder in its village, fiddling with its hands. Evan zoomed in. The subject had worked the end of a long, straight stick to a point. That wasn't something Evan had seen homo sapiens do before.

He fast-forwarded back to the encounter with the lioness. The homo sapien had been on its way to the neighboring watering hole and had brought its invention along, perhaps to use the stick as a means to collect the catfish that resided at the bottom, when the cat sprang.

What did it all mean? Evan watched on as the years passed. The village dwindled, withered, and blew away with the wind.

In his final report on the matter, Evan concluded, "The collapse of the homo sapien village can be traced back to that fateful invention. Their elder had learned how to do something new, of apparently dubious value, at the expense of forgetting something old of importance. Afterwards, circumstances that the village had persevered through in younger days presented anew, and with their collective experience lost to the lioness, they succumbed."

Evan committed to fixing the bug in iteration forty.
