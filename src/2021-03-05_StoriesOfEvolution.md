Joe, a long, slender insect, started to sweat. He stood face to face with his stronger, heavier rival, Bill, on a branch of the tree they both called home. It wasn't pride on the line, it was life.

Joe and Bill had never appreciated each others' company. In fact, they found each other quite grating. Joe was a know-it-all, and Bill was somewhat of a meathead. The day had come to resolve who was welcome to enjoy the tree's fruitful splendor and who would be relegated to certain death on the forest floor below.

As they stared each other down, a crowd gathered around them. Fights like these weren't uncommon, and the familiar catcalls for violence began to sound off.

Joe was sure that combat with Bill meant injury, and injury guaranteed death. Falling? Maybe not. "We never see anyone who falls ever again, but maybe that's because they like it down there," he thought. It was worth a shot; he decided to throw the fight, incur the defeat, and avoid the wound.

Bill's obsidian eye twitched, and then he lunged. Joe closed his eyes and steeled himself. Then, shrill screams of terror erupted from all around.

Joe's eyes sprang open to find the last glimpse of Bill he, or anyone, would ever have: in the clutches of a bird's gnarled claw. The bird had been drawn by the commotion of the crowd, and had greedily selected the plumpest, juiciest of prey from the smörgåsbord: Bill. As the bird took flight, insect in tow, Bill's eye glimmered for the last time.

Joe and his progeny were happy to discover that things happened that way more often than not. The longer, more slender, and more stick-like they became with each generation, the less they had to worry about birds and Bills, until they looked like branches themselves.

On iteration thirty-nine, coincidentally one fewer than it took the WD-40 company to get their formula right, Evolution's design for homo sapiens was tough and flexible enough to survive everything the Horn of Africa had to offer, and that was a problem.

After putting the time and effort into enabling homo sapiens to think about their problems, they now had practically none. The storms had come and gone, and the homo sapiens survived. Famines, too. Everything had been tried. Evolution thought about hanging up his hat.

As he flipped the light switch on his way out of the office, perhaps for the last time, something occurred to Evolution: nothing hadn't been tried. That is to say, "nothing" hadn't been tried. It was an odd notion, but what did he have to lose?

Evolution got to the office early the next morning, poured a cup of coffee, and got down to business. He watched, and he waited, and the homo sapiens did well, excelled, even. He waited some more.

His eyes started to strain as the light of the day waned from the window. His fifth cup of coffee had him feeling like a salted slug. A daydream began to float through his mind, but then he noticed something odd.

An older homo sapien, one that had valiantly weathered life, made a mistake. It left its village alone at dusk; a nearby lioness noticed and capitalized on the opportunity to turn the homo sapien into a meal.

Evolution sat back and pondered the event. It was a grave mistake, to leave alone at dusk, one that homo sapiens strictly avoided. This elder should have known better - why hadn't it?

Evolution rewound the tape a few hours. He found the elder in its village, fiddling with its hands. Evolution zoomed in. The subject was tying a flat, pointy stone to the end of a stick. That wasn't something Evolution had seen homo sapiens do before.

He fast-forwarded back to the encounter with the lioness. The homo sapien had brought its invention along, and had attempted to use it in defense when the cat sprang, to no avail.

He monitored the village for a few more years. It dwindled, withered, and blew away in the wind. In his final report on the matter, he concluded, "the collapse of the homo sapien village can be traced back to the loss of their elder. The elder had learned something new of dubious value at the expense of forgetting something old of importance, which culminated in its final, fatal mistake."

He committed to fixing the bug in iteration forty.
